    "text": "Here, we aim to provide guidance to which module is right for you at the moment. This guidance is automated, and depends on your answers to the questions below. This is not an exam, and your answers are not recorded. There are no right or wrong answers for the purpose of suggesting a module. As we don’t record answers, in requesting a switch to a more advanced level module, please download the “module_guidance.csv” file by clicking on the button at the bottom of this page. You should include this file when requesting a module change via email.\nBy answering the questions below, we will provide you with automated guidance. This should not be taken as definite, as individual cases vary.

The deadline for switching modules is the end of induction week, so you don’t miss vital teaching due to changing modules after teaching started. The pace of the modules is high and it will be difficult to catch up on missed initial content. Therefore, changing modules is not possible past the end of the first week of teaching.\nThe procedure for switching modules is as follows:\n\nRead the “Modules overview” page carefully.\nComplete the questions in the “Module guidance” page read the advice carefully.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The names of the modules reflect the approach taken and topics covered. There is no difference in the quality of the education they provide. Our aim is to provide the best education to all students, whilst at the same time matching it to your needs, interests, and abilities. All modules are supported by openly available materials and a mix of pre-recorded lectures, live Q&A sessions, and practical lab classes.\n\nFundamental module (PSYC0223)\nThe fundamental module is suitable for students without or with only limited prior statistics experience. It covers in an intuitive manner the most widely-used analyses in psychology and language sciences, such as linear regression and analysis-of-variance (ANOVA). The focus is on conceptual understanding and statistical literacy over technical details. Experience in applying the analyses is provided in practical sessions, where students are guided on using modern statistical software with a point-and-click interface (JAMOVI). JAMOVI is free and open-source statistical software, which like software such as SPSS, aims to make statistical analyses straightforward to apply for a general audience.\nTeaching consists of pre-recorded video lectures, a weekly in-person Q&A session, and a weekly in-person practical class. Assessment for the module consists of a single piece of coursework where you are asked to report the results of statistical analysis of a provided dataset. In addition, 10% of your mark will be based on the completion of weekly homework assignments.\nTopics covered in each week are:\n\nIntro to the General Linear Model (Regression) & Correlation\nMultiple Regression\nCategorical Regression\nMixed continuous-categorical Regression\nMediation and moderation\nNull Hypothesis Significance Testing and the Replication Crisis\nRepeated Measures and mixed ‘Between-Within’ designs\nBinary Logistic Regression\nBayes and the p value\nPower and Confidence Intervals\n\n\n\nIntermediate module (PALS0049)\nThe Intermediate module is suitable for students without prior statistics experience, or students with some prior statistics experience who want or need to learn to use the R statistical programming language. The Intermediate module covers similar topics as the Fundamental module (e.g. regression and ANOVA), with a focus on the technical aspects of applying these techniques with R. R is a widely used programming language for data science, and a sought-after skill in many professions with a data-analytic component. R is a programming environment that benefits from a large amount of add-on packages that enable a wealth of more advanced analyses. The Intermediate module will mainly focus on the use of the tidyverse and afex packages.\nUsing R effectively requires writing writing scripts, rather than selecting options in a menu as in point-and-click software such as JAMOVI. The Intermediate module provides a relatively gentle introduction to R programming, but because of the additional time spent on learning R, you will have to grasp statical concepts more quickly than in the Fundamental module. As such, the learning curve can be considered steeper than in the Fundamental module. A main consideration for switching to the Intermediate module is whether you are interested in learning to program in R.\nTeaching consists of pre-recorded video lectures, a weekly in-person Q&A session, and a weekly in-person practical class. Assessment for the module consists of a single piece of coursework where you are asked to report the results of statistical analysis of a provided dataset. In addition, 10% of your mark will be based on the completion of weekly homework assignments.\nTopics covered in each week are:\n\nIntroduction to Research Methods + Why do we need Statistics?\nIntroduction to R and tidyverse\nData Visualisation with ggplot2\nThe Standard Statistical Approach for One Independent Variable\nUnderstanding Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST)\nCorrelation and Regression\nANOVA with one IV with more than 2 Levels\nANOVA with 2 Factors and Interaction\nANOVA with Repeated-Measures Factor\nANOVA with both Repeated-Measures and Between-Subjects Factor\n\nThe module is supported by the online book Introduction to Statistics for Experimental Psychology with R. If you are considering switching to this module, you are advised to preview this material to see whether the approach fits your needs.\n\n\nAdvanced module (PSYC0146)\nThe Advanced module is suitable for students with prior statistics experience. It may also be suitable for students without statistics experience who have the technical (mathematical/programming) skills to quickly grasp the statistical concepts covered. The Advanced module provides a unified framework of statistical inference as model comparison. It offers a refresher of the General Linear Model (GLM), the most widely-used model within this framework, before moving on to more advanced techniques such as linear mixed-effects models, generalized linear models, structural equation models (SEM), and Bayesian estimation and inference. In comparison to the Fundamental and Intermediate modules, the pace is high and the focus more theoretical and technical. Like the Intermediate module, the module uses R to perform statistical analyses. However, the Advanced module does not provide a “gentle” introduction to R. Those without prior R experience will have to put in additional effort to acquire basic R skills.\nTeaching consists of pre-recorded video lectures, a weekly in-person Q&A session, and a weekly in-person practical class. Assessment for the module consists of a single piece of coursework where you are asked to report the results of statistical analysis of a provided dataset. In addition, 10% of your mark will be based on the completion of weekly homework assignments.\nTopics covered in each week are:\n\nIntroduction to statistical modelling\nRegression and moderation (GLM 1)\nOneway and factorial ANOVA (GLM 2)\nANCOVA and linear mixed-effects models 1\nLinear mixed-effects models 2\nGeneralized linear models\nPath models (SEM 1)\nLatent variable models (SEM 2)\nBayesian estimation\nBayesian model comparison\n\nThe module is supported by two online books: Statistics: Data analysis and modelling and An R companion to Statistics: Data analysis and modelling. If you are considering switching to this module, you are advised to preview these materials to see whether the approach fits your needs."

    "text": "There are three statistics modules offered by postgraduate programmes at UCL Psychology and Language Sciences (PaLS). These are pitched at a fundamental, intermediate, and advanced level. All three modules share the same basic philosophy, which is to provide statistical literacy as a transferable skill, using state-of-the-art and freely available open-source software. That means that you can apply your acquired knowledge anywhere, and and at all times.\nEach postgraduate programme sets a default module. Depending on your experience and ability, it may be possible for you to switch to a module pitched at a higher level than the default for your programme. By switching to a different module, you may enhance your learning opportunity and acquire new relevant transferable skills. The module you take is also reflected on your degree transcript, and taking a higher-level module could be beneficial to later opportunities. The main thing to consider is which module is right for you at this time. There are always opportunities for later learning. In all modules, we aim to provide the best learning experience for our students. In the end, there should be no penalty for choosing the module that is right for you."
